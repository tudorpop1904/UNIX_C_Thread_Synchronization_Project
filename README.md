# UNIX C Thread Synchronization Project

# Brief Description

This project stands as an assignment provided by my Operating Systems lecturer in my second year of college. It aims to solve various problems involving operating system threads, semaphores, and mutual exclusion locks. For more details about the requirements, one may consult the "a2_ro.pdf"/"a2_en.pdf" files for the romanian/english versions of the assignment respectively. A Python autograder program named "tester.py" was also provided to test the functionality of the program in regards to the requirements of the assignment.

# Software Requirements and Usage:

A UNIX based system will be required. In order to run the program from the command line, you may use the commands specified either in the "a2.c" source code, or in the aforementioned PDF files, and, in order to further test the functionality without running commands, you can run the autograder program by typing "python3 tester.py --docker" in the command line.
